## Implementation Details

### Hand Detection and Tracking

GhostTouch implements hand tracking using MediaPipe's hand solution, augmented with custom processing for improved reliability:

```python
def find_hands(self, img: cv2.Mat, draw: bool = True) -> cv2.Mat:
    """
    Find hands in the image.
    
    Args:
        img: Input image in BGR format.
        draw: Whether to draw hand landmarks on the image.
        
    Returns:
        Image with hand landmarks drawn if draw=True.
    """
    img_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
    self.results = self.hands.process(img_rgb)

    if self.results.multi_hand_landmarks and draw:
        for hand_landmarks in self.results.multi_hand_landmarks:
            self.mp_draw.draw_landmarks(
                img, 
                hand_landmarks,
                self.mp_hands.HAND_CONNECTIONS
            )
    return img
```

The system detects 21 landmarks per hand, enabling precise tracking of finger positions and movements. The implementation optimizes for real-time performance while maintaining accuracy suitable for control applications.

### Enhanced Finger Position Tracking

The updated finger position tracking system now includes hand orientation awareness for more accurate finger state detection:

```python
def detect_fingers(self, landmark_list: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Detect which fingers are extended based on landmark positions with hand orientation awareness.
    
    Args:
        landmark_list: List of hand landmark positions from MediaPipe.
            
    Returns:
        List of binary values indicating which fingers are extended (1) or folded (0).
    """
    if not landmark_list:
        return []
            
    fingers = []
    
    # Thumb detection requires special handling due to its different movement axis
    thumb_tip = landmark_list[FINGER_IDS[0]]
    thumb_base = landmark_list[FINGER_IDS[0] - 1]
    
    # Determine hand orientation (left/right) using wrist and base of middle finger positions
    hand_direction = "right" if landmark_list[17][1] > landmark_list[5][1] else "left"
    
    # Adjust thumb extension detection based on hand direction
    if hand_direction == "right":
        fingers.append(1 if thumb_tip[1] < thumb_base[1] else 0)  # Right hand: extended if x is smaller
    else:
        fingers.append(1 if thumb_tip[1] > thumb_base[1] else 0)  # Left hand: extended if x is larger
            
    # Other fingers - compare fingertip position to lower knuckle
    for finger_id in FINGER_IDS[1:]:
        finger_tip = landmark_list[finger_id]
        finger_base = landmark_list[finger_id - 2]  # Lower joint of the finger
        fingers.append(1 if finger_tip[2] < finger_base[2] else 0)  # Extended if tip is higher than base
    
    # Calculate and store thumb-index distance for gesture recognition
    if len(landmark_list) > 8:  # Ensure we have both thumb and index landmarks
        self.thumb_index_distance = math.hypot(
            landmark_list[4][1] - landmark_list[8][1],  # X-difference
            landmark_list[4][2] - landmark_list[8][2]   # Y-difference
        )
        self.finger_distance_history.append(self.thumb_index_distance)  # Add to history for smoothing
    
    return fingers
```

This enhanced implementation accurately detects finger states regardless of hand orientation, making the system more robust across different users and hand positions.

### Advanced Mode Switching Logic with Hysteresis

The updated system implements a sophisticated mode switching mechanism with hysteresis to prevent accidental mode changes:

```python
def update_mode(self, fingers: List[int]) -> None:
    """
    Advanced mode switching with hysteresis and gesture stability analysis.
    
    Args:
        fingers: List of binary values indicating which fingers are extended.
    """
    if not fingers:
        self.pending_mode = None
        self.mode_switch_counter = 0
        return
            
    # Create unique gesture key and add to history
    gesture_key = ''.join(map(str, fingers))
    self.gesture_history.append(gesture_key)
    
    # Determine appropriate mode based on current gesture
    if fingers == [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]:  # Fist/closed hand - Reset mode
        new_mode = 'N'
    elif self.is_scroll_up_gesture(fingers) or self.is_scroll_down_gesture(fingers):
        new_mode = 'Scroll'
    elif self.is_volume_gesture(fingers):
        new_mode = 'Volume'
    else:
        new_mode = self.mode  # Maintain current mode if gesture not recognized
    
    # Mode switching with hysteresis to prevent accidental mode changes
    if new_mode != self.pending_mode:
        # Reset counter when pending mode changes
        self.pending_mode = new_mode
        self.mode_switch_counter = 0
    else:
        # Increment stability counter for consistent gesture
        self.mode_switch_counter += 1
            
        # Only switch mode after stable period of the same gesture
        if self.mode_switch_counter >= self.mode_switch_threshold and new_mode != self.mode:
            self._switch_mode(new_mode)
```

This hysteresis-based approach requires gestures to be held consistently for multiple frames before activating, substantially reducing accidental mode switches while still allowing for responsive control.

### Improved Gesture Recognition

The system now employs more sophisticated gesture detection methods with clearer distinctions between similar gestures:

```python
def is_volume_gesture(self, fingers: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    Advanced detection of volume control gesture using both finger pattern and positioning.
    
    Args:
        fingers: List indicating which fingers are extended.
            
    Returns:
        True if valid volume control gesture is detected, False otherwise.
    """
    if not fingers or len(fingers) < 5:
        return False
            
    # Check basic finger pattern: thumb + index extended, others closed
    basic_pattern = (fingers[0] == 1 and fingers[1] == 1 and 
                    fingers[2] == 0 and fingers[3] == 0 and fingers[4] == 0)
    
    # Verify proper thumb-index positioning with sufficient distance
    pinch_position = self.thumb_index_distance > MIN_VOLUME_GESTURE_LENGTH
    
    return basic_pattern and pinch_position
```

This approach combines both finger extension patterns and spatial relationships between fingers, providing more reliable gesture recognition with fewer false positives.

### Enhanced Volume Control Implementation

The volume control mode now incorporates temporal smoothing for more stable adjustment:

```python
def _update_volume(self, landmark_list: List[List[int]], img: cv2.Mat) -> None:
    """
    Update system volume based on finger positions with smooth transitions.
    
    Args:
        landmark_list: List of hand landmark positions.
        img: Image to draw visual feedback on.
    """
    # Get thumb and index finger tip positions
    x1, y1 = landmark_list[4][1], landmark_list[4][2]  # Thumb tip
    x2, y2 = landmark_list[8][1], landmark_list[8][2]  # Index tip
    cx, cy = (x1 + x2) // 2, (y1 + y2) // 2  # Center point between fingers
    
    # Draw enhanced visual connection between control fingers
    self._draw_finger_connection(x1, y1, x2, y2, cx, cy, img)
    
    # Calculate current finger distance for volume mapping
    length = math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)
    
    # Apply temporal smoothing using weighted moving average
    if len(self.finger_distance_history) > 0:
        # 70% current value + 30% historical average for stability
        smoothed_length = 0.7 * length + 0.3 * (sum(self.finger_distance_history) / len(self.finger_distance_history))
    else:
        smoothed_length = length
    
    # Map distance to volume level with proper range conversion
    vol = np.interp(smoothed_length, [HAND_RANGE[0], HAND_RANGE[1]], [VOLUME_RANGE[0], VOLUME_RANGE[1]])
    
    # Apply volume change to system
    self.volume.SetMasterVolumeLevel(vol, None)
    
    # Update visual indicators with smoothed values
    self._update_volume_feedback(smoothed_length, vol, img)
```

The implementation now includes weighted temporal averaging of finger distances, resulting in smoother volume transitions while maintaining responsiveness.

### Physics-Based Scrolling with Adaptive Momentum

The scrolling functionality has been completely reworked to incorporate physics-based momentum and adaptive speed control:

```python
def handle_scroll_mode(self, fingers: List[int], landmark_list: List[List[int]], img: cv2.Mat) -> None:
    """
    Enhanced scroll handling with adaptive speed and momentum physics.
    
    Args:
        fingers: List of binary values indicating which fingers are extended.
        landmark_list: List of hand landmark positions.
        img: Image to draw visual feedback on.
    """
    current_time = time.time()
    
    # Adaptive speed adjustment based on continuous scrolling
    time_scrolling = current_time - self.last_scroll_time
    if time_scrolling < 0.5:  # If actively scrolling (within last 500ms)
        # Gradually increase speed for sustained scrolling (up to 50% faster)
        self.adaptive_scroll_speed = min(self.adaptive_scroll_speed * 1.01, 1.5)
    else:
        # Reset to default speed when not actively scrolling
        self.adaptive_scroll_speed = 1.0
    
    # Respect scrolling cooldown while still applying momentum
    if current_time - self.last_scroll_time < self.scroll_cooldown:
        # Apply momentum even during cooldown for smoother transition
        self._handle_scroll_momentum()
        return
            
    # Calculate new scroll speed based on current finger positions
    scroll_speed = self.calculate_scroll_speed(landmark_list)
    
    # Dynamic momentum physics based on scroll speed
    momentum_modifier = np.interp(scroll_speed, 
                                SCROLL_SPEED_RANGE, 
                                [0.9, 0.95])  # Higher speed = more momentum
    
    # Process specific scroll gestures with dynamic feedback
    if self.is_scroll_up_gesture(fingers):  # Scroll up gesture detected
        self._handle_scroll_up(scroll_speed, img)
        SCROLL_MOMENTUM_DECAY = momentum_modifier  # Update momentum decay rate
    elif self.is_scroll_down_gesture(fingers):  # Scroll down gesture detected
        self._handle_scroll_down(scroll_speed, img)
        SCROLL_MOMENTUM_DECAY = momentum_modifier  # Update momentum decay rate
    else:
        # Apply existing momentum if no active scroll gesture
        self._handle_scroll_momentum()
                
    self.last_scroll_time = current_time  # Update timestamp for cooldown
    self._draw_scroll_feedback(img)  # Update visual feedback
```

This implementation provides a more natural scrolling experience with realistic physics, including momentum, variable decay rates, and adaptive speed adjustment based on usage patterns.
