## Implementation Details

### Hand Detection and Tracking

GhostTouch implements hand tracking using MediaPipe's hand solution, augmented with custom processing for improved reliability:

```python
def find_hands(self, img: cv2.Mat, draw: bool = True) -> cv2.Mat:
    """
    Find hands in the image.
    
    Args:
        img: Input image in BGR format.
        draw: Whether to draw hand landmarks on the image.
        
    Returns:
        Image with hand landmarks drawn if draw=True.
    """
    img_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
    self.results = self.hands.process(img_rgb)

    if self.results.multi_hand_landmarks and draw:
        for hand_landmarks in self.results.multi_hand_landmarks:
            self.mp_draw.draw_landmarks(
                img, 
                hand_landmarks,
                self.mp_hands.HAND_CONNECTIONS
            )
    return img
```

The system detects 21 landmarks per hand, enabling precise tracking of finger positions and movements. The implementation optimizes for real-time performance while maintaining accuracy suitable for control applications.

### Finger Position Tracking

Finger position tracking determines which fingers are extended using a combination of landmark relationships:

```python
def detect_fingers(self, landmark_list: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Detect which fingers are extended based on landmark positions.
    
    Args:
        landmark_list: List of hand landmark positions.
        
    Returns:
        List of binary values indicating which fingers are extended (1) or folded (0).
    """
    if not landmark_list:
        return []
        
    fingers = []
    
    # Thumb detection (different for left/right hand)
    thumb_base = landmark_list[FINGER_IDS[0] - 1]
    thumb_tip = landmark_list[FINGER_IDS[0]]
    fingers.append(1 if thumb_tip[1] >= thumb_base[1] else 0)
        
    # Other fingers
    for finger_id in FINGER_IDS[1:]:
        finger_tip = landmark_list[finger_id]
        finger_base = landmark_list[finger_id - 2]
        fingers.append(1 if finger_tip[2] < finger_base[2] else 0)
        
    return fingers
```

This approach provides robust finger state detection necessary for reliable gesture recognition across different hand sizes and orientations.

### Mode Switching Logic

GhostTouch implements a state-based mode system for context-aware gesture interpretation:

```python
def update_mode(self, fingers: List[int]) -> None:
    """
    Update the current control mode based on finger positions.
    
    Args:
        fingers: List of binary values indicating which fingers are extended.
    """
    if not fingers:
        return
        
    if fingers == [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]:  # Fist - Reset mode
        self._reset_mode()
    elif (fingers == [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] or fingers == [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]) and not self.active:
        self._set_scroll_mode()
    elif (fingers == [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]) and not self.active:
        self._set_volume_mode()
```

This state machine approach allows the system to maintain contextual awareness and prevent accidental mode switching during gesture execution.

### Volume Control Implementation

The volume control mode uses the distance between thumb and index finger to create an intuitive pinch-to-adjust interaction:

```python
def _update_volume(self, landmark_list: List[List[int]], img: cv2.Mat) -> None:
    """Update system volume based on finger positions."""
    # Get thumb and index finger positions
    x1, y1 = landmark_list[4][1], landmark_list[4][2]
    x2, y2 = landmark_list[8][1], landmark_list[8][2]
    cx, cy = (x1 + x2) // 2, (y1 + y2) // 2
    
    # Draw finger connection
    self._draw_finger_connection(x1, y1, x2, y2, cx, cy, img)
    
    # Calculate and set volume
    length = math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)
    vol = np.interp(length, [HAND_RANGE[0], HAND_RANGE[1]], [VOLUME_RANGE[0], VOLUME_RANGE[1]])
    self.volume.SetMasterVolumeLevel(vol, None)
    
    # Update visual feedback
    self._update_volume_feedback(length, vol, img)
```

The implementation maps the physical distance between fingers to a volume range, creating an intuitive control metaphor with visual feedback.

### Scrolling with Momentum

The scrolling implementation features natural momentum for a more fluid user experience:

```python
def _handle_scroll_momentum(self) -> None:
    """Handle scroll momentum when no gesture is detected."""
    if abs(self.scroll_momentum) > 0.1:
        pyautogui.scroll(int(self.scroll_momentum))
        self.scroll_momentum *= SCROLL_MOMENTUM_DECAY
    else:
        self.scroll_momentum = 0
```

This momentum-based approach makes scrolling feel more natural by continuing the scrolling action with gradually decreasing speed after the gesture ends.

## Performance Optimization

GhostTouch incorporates several optimizations to ensure smooth performance:

### Gesture Recognition Optimization

- **Detection confidence thresholds**: Configurable confidence values balance accuracy vs. performance
- **Processing optimizations**: Minimal necessary landmark tracking and calculations
- **State-based processing**: Different computational loads based on active modes

### Video Processing Efficiency

- **Resolution optimization**: Standard 640x480 processing resolution
- **Frame rate management**: Adaptive processing based on system capabilities
- **Minimal drawing operations**: Optimized visual feedback rendering

### Memory Management

- **Efficient data structures**: Use of NumPy arrays for numerical operations
- **Minimal state persistence**: Only essential information maintained between frames
- **On-demand processing**: Feature calculation only when needed for active modes

## Benchmarks and Performance

Performance metrics from testing on reference hardware:

- **CPU**: Intel Core i5 (10th gen)
- **RAM**: 8GB
- **Camera**: Standard 720p webcam

| Configuration | FPS | Latency (ms) | CPU Usage (%) |
|---------------|-----|--------------|--------------|
| Idle (detection only) | 58-62 | 16-18 | 15-20 |
| Volume Control | 45-55 | 18-22 | 25-30 |
| Scrolling (active) | 42-52 | 20-24 | 28-35 |

The system maintains real-time performance suitable for fluid interaction on standard consumer hardware without requiring GPU acceleration.

## Supported Gestures

GhostTouch implements a carefully selected set of gestures optimized for reliability and intuitive use:

| Gesture | Description | Action |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Closed Fist | All fingers closed | Reset to idle state |
| Index Finger | Only index finger extended | Scroll up (speed based on distance) |
| Index + Middle Fingers | Two fingers extended | Scroll down (speed based on distance) |
| Thumb + Index Finger | Thumb and index extended | Volume control (distance controls level) |

➡️ **To quit**, simply press `q` on your keyboard.

These gestures were selected based on:
- Distinctiveness from natural hand positions
- Ease of execution and maintenance
- Minimal conflict with other common gestures
- Reliable detection across different hand sizes and orientations
